# Materials in the Natural World – Cross‑Phase Science Teaching Resource Pack

## Purpose
This repository hosts a collection of teaching resources designed to create cohesive learning experiences that bridge different science disciplines and educational phases. It draws on the author’s experience with a challenging chemistry demonstration (preparation of iron(II) sulfide), the UK primary science curriculum, and the resources offered by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL). The pack aims to help teachers deliver engaging, cross‑curricular science lessons that link materials and their properties to real‑world examples from the animal kingdom.

## Target Audience
- Primary and secondary school science teachers
- Trainee teachers and teacher educators
- Science curriculum coordinators
- Educators planning school trips to zoos or natural‑history museums

## Proposed Structure
The resource pack is organised into three core components:

1. **Chemistry Demonstration Lesson Plan** – A step‑by‑step guide for the preparation of iron(II) sulfide, including safety notes, common pitfalls, and suggestions for making the demonstration more reliable and engaging.

2. **Primary Curriculum Mapping Document** – A table that links the concepts covered in the resource pack to the learning objectives of the UK primary science curriculum, showing how the activities support progression in ‘Materials and their Properties’.

3. **ZSL‑Inspired ‘Animal Materials’ Activity** – A worksheet or activity that can be used before or after a trip to the Zoological Society of London. It focuses on how animals use different materials (shells, fur, scales, etc.) for survival, and encourages pupils to think about materials in a biological context.

## How to Use
1. Browse the relevant folder for the resource you need.
2. Download the Markdown file (or view it directly on GitHub) and adapt it for your own classroom.
3. Refer to the curriculum‑mapping document to see how the activity fits into the broader primary science framework.
4. Use the ZSL activity as a pre‑ or post‑visit task to enhance a school trip to the zoo.
