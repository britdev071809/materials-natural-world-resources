# Animal Materials – A ZSL‑Inspired Activity

## Purpose
This activity is designed to be used before or after a visit to the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) zoo. It encourages pupils to think about the materials that animals produce or use, and how those materials help them survive in their habitats. The activity links the science topic ‘Materials and their Properties’ to real‑world biology, fostering cross‑curricular connections.

## Suggested Timing
- **Pre‑visit:** 30 minutes in the classroom to introduce the concepts and set the investigation.
- **During the visit:** Pupils can use the worksheet as a scavenger hunt while observing animals.
- **Post‑visit:** 30–40 minutes to discuss findings, complete the tables, and extend the learning.

## Learning Objectives
Pupils will be able to:
- Identify different materials that animals produce (e.g., shells, fur, scales, feathers, silk, wax).
- Describe how each material helps the animal survive (protection, warmth, camouflage, etc.).
- Compare natural materials with human‑made materials that serve similar functions.
- Record observations systematically and present findings to peers.

## Resources Needed
- Printed copies of this worksheet (one per pupil or per group).
- Clipboards and pencils for recording during the zoo visit.
- Access to ZSL London Zoo or Whipsnade Zoo (or any local zoo/wildlife park).
- Optional: magnifying glasses, cameras (for taking photos of animal features).

## Activity 1: Materials Scavenger Hunt
While walking around the zoo, look for animals that use the materials listed below. For each material, try to find at least one example and note the animal’s name, where you saw it, and how the material helps the animal.

| Material | Example animal | Where seen (enclosure) | How does it help the animal? |
|----------|----------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Hard shell** (e.g., turtle, snail) | | | |
| **Fur or hair** | | | |
| **Feathers** | | | |
| **Scales** (fish, reptile) | | | |
| **Spines or quills** | | | |
| **Web or silk** | | | |
| **Antlers or horns** | | | |
| **Camouflage patterns** (not a material, but a use of colour) | | | |
| **Other interesting material** (e.g., wax, venom, mucus) | | | |

## Activity 2: Material Properties
Choose **two** of the animals you observed and think about the properties of the materials they use. Complete the table below.

| Animal | Material | Property (e.g., hard, flexible, waterproof, insulating) | Why is this property useful? |
|--------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

## Activity 3: Compare with Human‑Made Materials
Many of the materials animals produce have inspired human inventions. Match the natural material with a human‑made material that has a similar function.

| Natural material | Human‑made equivalent | Why are they similar? |
|------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Bird feathers | Down jacket | Both trap air to keep warm. |
| Spider silk | Kevlar® or nylon rope | Both are strong and flexible. |
| Turtle shell | Safety helmet | Both protect against impact. |
| Fish scales | Roof tiles or armour plating | Both overlap to provide protection. |
| Porcupine quills | Barbed wire | Both deter predators by being sharp and difficult to remove. |

**Challenge:** Can you think of another example where humans have copied a material from nature? Draw or describe it.

## Discussion Questions (Post‑visit)
1. Which material did you find most interesting? Why?
2. How might an animal’s material change with the seasons? (Hint: think about fur thickness, colour of feathers.)
3. If you could design a new material for an animal to help it survive in a changing environment, what would it be and why?
4. Why is it important for scientists to study animal materials? (Consider medicine, engineering, conservation.)

## Extension Ideas
- **Art and design:** Create a collage using pictures of different animal materials, labelling each with its function.
- **Creative writing:** Write a short story from the perspective of an animal that uses its material to overcome a challenge (e.g., a turtle using its shell to escape a predator).
- **Science investigation:** Test the strength of different natural fibres (e.g., compare thread from a spider web with cotton thread).
- **Link to chemistry:** Research what animal materials are made of (e.g., keratin in hair and feathers, calcium carbonate in shells, chitin in insect exoskeletons).

## Notes for Teachers
- This activity can be adapted for different age groups. For younger pupils, focus on recognising materials and their basic functions. For older pupils, introduce concepts like adaptation, biomimicry, and material composition.
- If a zoo visit is not possible, use video clips, books, or virtual zoo tours to provide examples.
- Emphasise respect for animals and their habitats—observe quietly and do not disturb the animals.
- Use the scavenger hunt as a basis for a class discussion about adaptation and evolution.
