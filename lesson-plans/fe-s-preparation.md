# Preparation of Iron(II) Sulfide – A Reliable Classroom Demonstration

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, pupils will be able to:
- Describe the reaction between iron and sulfur as an example of a chemical change.
- Explain the importance of correct reactant ratios and heating conditions.
- Recognise the properties of the product (iron(II) sulfide) compared to the reactants.
- Discuss safety considerations when handling powdered chemicals and using a Bunsen burner.

## Apparatus and Chemicals
| Item | Quantity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Iron powder (reduced iron) | 7.0 g | Must be finely powdered; avoid coarse filings. |
| Sulfur powder (flowers of sulfur) | 4.0 g | Use pure, dry sulfur; store in a dry place. |
| Hard‑glass test tube (Pyrex®) | 1 | Preferably 150 mm × 25 mm, heat‑resistant. |
| Bunsen burner with tripod and gauze | 1 | Ensure the burner is in a working‑order safety flame when not in use. |
| Test‑tube holder (clamp) | 1 | To hold the test tube safely while heating. |
| Heat‑resistant mat | 1 | For placing hot apparatus. |
| Safety goggles | per person | Must be worn throughout. |
| Lab coat / apron | per person | Protect clothing. |
| Spatula and weighing boat | 1 each | For measuring powders. |
| Magnet (e.g., small bar magnet) | 1 | For testing magnetic properties before/after. |
| White tile or piece of paper | 1 | To observe colour change. |

## Method

### 1. Preparation (Teacher demonstration)
- **Weighing:** Measure exactly 7.0 g of iron powder and 4.0 g of sulfur powder. The 7:4 mass ratio corresponds to the stoichiometric 1:1 molar ratio (Fe:S ≈ 56:32). An excess of either reactant will leave unreacted material.
- **Mixing:** Combine the two powders on a clean piece of paper and mix thoroughly with a spatula. *Tip:* Mix for at least one minute to ensure intimate contact. A homogeneous mixture reacts more completely.
- **Loading:** Transfer the mixture into a clean, dry hard‑glass test tube. Gently tap the tube to settle the powder, but do not compact it tightly (air needs to escape during heating).

### 2. Heating
- **Safety check:** Confirm that all pupils are wearing safety goggles and are at a safe distance. The demonstration should be performed in a well‑ventilated laboratory (sulfur dioxide may be produced).
- **Heating procedure:**
  1. Clamp the test tube at a slight angle (mouth pointing away from anyone) and position the Bunsen burner so the flame can heat the lower third of the tube.
  2. Begin with a gentle blue flame, moving it slowly along the length of the tube to pre‑heat the glass and drive off any moisture.
  3. Once the tube is warm, concentrate the flame on the region containing the powder. **Important:** Heat strongly until the mixture just begins to glow. As soon as a distinct red‑hot region propagates through the powder, immediately remove the heat.
  4. The reaction is exothermic; once initiated it will often continue without further heating. Allow the tube to cool on a heat‑proof mat.

### 3. Observations and Testing
- **Colour change:** The grey‑yellow mixture turns into a dark grey/black solid.
- **Magnetic test:** Before the reaction, both iron and the mixture are attracted to a magnet. After cooling, the product (iron(II) sulfide) is **not** magnetic. Demonstrate this with a small magnet.
- **Break the tube (optional):** Once completely cool, the brittle product can be extracted by carefully breaking the test tube (wrap in a cloth and strike gently). **Only perform this if your risk assessment permits.** Show pupils the metallic‑looking lump of FeS.

## Why Demonstrations Fail – Troubleshooting Guide
| Problem | Likely cause | Remedy |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| No reaction, mixture just chars | Insufficient heating or moisture present | Ensure powder is dry; pre‑heat the tube gently to drive off water vapour, then apply strong heat until a clear red glow starts. |
| Only part of the mixture reacts | Incomplete mixing or uneven heating | Mix powders thoroughly before loading; heat the tube evenly along the powder column. |
| Excess sulfur melts and boils, producing dense fumes | Too much sulfur or overheating | Use exact 7:4 ratio; heat only until the reaction self‑propagates, then remove flame. Work in a fume cupboard if available. |
| Product is still magnetic | Unreacted iron left in the product | Check the mass ratio; ensure the mixture is homogeneous and heated strongly enough. |
| Test tube cracks during heating | Thermal shock or pre‑existing flaw | Use hard‑glass (Pyrex) tubes; pre‑heat gently; avoid heating empty sections of the tube. |

## Risk Assessment
| Hazard | Who is at risk | Control measures | Emergency action |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Burns from hot apparatus | Teacher, pupils | Use test‑tube holder; keep pupils at a safe distance; place hot items on heat‑proof mats. | Cool burn under cold running water for at least 10 minutes; seek medical help if severe. |
| Inhalation of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) | All in lab | Perform in a well‑ventilated room or fume cupboard; avoid overheating excess sulfur. | Move to fresh air; if breathing difficulties persist, seek medical attention. |
| Fire/ignition of sulfur dust | Teacher, pupils | Keep sulfur away from flames until deliberately heated; avoid creating dust clouds. | Use a fire blanket or CO₂ extinguisher for small fires; evacuate if necessary. |
| Eye injury from flying glass | Teacher, pupils | Wear safety goggles at all times; wrap tube in cloth if breaking. | If glass enters eye, do not rub; irrigate with eye wash and seek immediate medical help. |
| Allergic reaction to sulfur dust | Sensitive individuals | Minimise dust by handling powders carefully; wash hands after the demonstration. | Remove from exposure; if rash or breathing problems develop, seek medical advice. |

## Questions for Discussion
1. What visual changes tell you that a chemical reaction has taken place?
2. Why is it important to use the correct mass of iron and sulfur?
3. How does the magnetic test prove that a new substance has been formed?
4. Sulfur dioxide gas might be produced during this reaction. What safety precautions are needed to protect against this gas?
5. Can you think of any real‑world uses of sulfides? (e.g., in batteries, as pigments, in mineral processing.)

## Extension Ideas
- **Linking to industry:** Research the extraction of metal sulfides from ores and their use in the production of sulfuric acid.
- **Environmental angle:** Discuss acid mine drainage, where iron sulfides in exposed rock react with air and water to produce sulfuric acid.
- **Cross‑curricular link with biology:** Explore how some bacteria use iron sulfides in anaerobic respiration (e.g., in deep‑sea vents).

## Notes for Teachers
- This demonstration works best when the powders are fresh and dry. If the mixture fails to react, try a new batch of iron powder (old iron may have a surface oxide layer).
- The exothermic reaction can be quite vigorous; be prepared to move the flame away quickly.
- If you are not confident about breaking the tube, simply show the product inside the cooled test tube.
- Record your own observations and any modifications that improved the reliability—this is part of the action‑research cycle.
