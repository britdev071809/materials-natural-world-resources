# Primary Curriculum Mapping – Materials in the Natural World

## Overview
This document shows how the resources in the **Materials in the Natural World** pack align with the statutory requirements of the English National Curriculum for Science at primary level (Key Stages 1 and 2). The mapping focuses on the ‘Materials and their Properties’ strand, but also highlights cross‑curricular links to ‘Living Things and their Habitats’, ‘Working Scientifically’, and ‘Design and Technology’.

## Key Stage 1 (Years 1–2)

### National Curriculum Statements
- **Pupils should be taught to:**
  - Distinguish between an object and the material from which it is made.
  - Identify and name a variety of everyday materials, including wood, plastic, glass, metal, water, and rock.
  - Describe the simple physical properties of a variety of everyday materials.
  - Compare and group together a variety of everyday materials on the basis of their simple physical properties.

### How the Resource Pack Supports These Statements
| Curriculum statement | Resource | Activity / Link |
|----------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Identify and name a variety of everyday materials** | ZSL Animal Materials Activity | Pupils observe and name materials produced by animals (shells, fur, feathers, scales, etc.) – extending the concept of ‘materials’ beyond human‑made objects. |
| **Describe simple physical properties** | ZSL Animal Materials Activity | Table asking pupils to describe properties (hard, flexible, waterproof, insulating) of animal materials. |
| **Compare and group materials** | ZSL Animal Materials Activity | Pupils can group animals by the material they produce (e.g., animals with shells, animals with fur). |
| **Distinguish between object and material** | Iron(II) Sulfide Lesson Plan | The demonstration shows how two materials (iron and sulfur) react to form a new substance with different properties – helping pupils see that materials can change. |

## Lower Key Stage 2 (Years 3–4)

### National Curriculum Statements
- **Pupils should be taught to:**
  - Compare and group materials together, according to whether they are solids, liquids or gases.
  - Observe that some materials change state when they are heated or cooled, and measure or research the temperature at which this happens in degrees Celsius (°C).
  - Identify the part played by evaporation and condensation in the water cycle and associate the rate of evaporation with temperature.
  - **Materials:** Identify and compare the suitability of a variety of everyday materials, including wood, metal, plastic, glass, brick, rock, paper and cardboard for particular uses.

### How the Resource Pack Supports These Statements
| Curriculum statement | Resource | Activity / Link |
|----------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Compare and group materials (solids, liquids, gases)** | Iron(II) Sulfide Lesson Plan | The reaction involves solid reactants producing a solid product, but also may release sulfur dioxide gas – a tangible example of a gas being formed during a chemical change. |
| **Observe changes of state with heating/cooling** | Iron(II) Sulfide Lesson Plan | Heating is required to initiate the reaction; pupils can discuss how heat energy can cause permanent chemical changes as well as physical changes. |
| **Identify suitability of materials for particular uses** | ZSL Animal Materials Activity | Pupils explore how animal materials are ‘suited’ to survival (e.g., shells for protection, fur for insulation). They then compare these with human‑made materials that serve similar functions (biomimicry). |

## Upper Key Stage 2 (Years 5–6)

### National Curriculum Statements
- **Pupils should be taught to:**
  - **Properties and changes of materials:**
    - Compare and group together everyday materials on the basis of their properties, including hardness, solubility, transparency, conductivity (electrical and thermal), and response to magnets.
    - Give reasons, based on evidence from comparative and fair tests, for the particular uses of everyday materials, including metals, wood and plastic.
    - Demonstrate that dissolving, mixing and changes of state are reversible changes.
    - Explain that some changes result in the formation of new materials, and that this kind of change is not usually reversible, including changes associated with burning and the action of acid on bicarbonate of soda.
  - **Living things and their habitats:** Describe how living things are classified into broad groups according to common observable characteristics and based on similarities and differences, including microorganisms, plants and animals.

### How the Resource Pack Supports These Statements
| Curriculum statement | Resource | Activity / Link |
|----------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Compare materials based on properties (hardness, magnetic response)** | Iron(II) Sulfide Lesson Plan | The magnetic test (iron is magnetic, iron(II) sulfide is not) provides a clear example of a property change due to a chemical reaction. |
| **Explain that some changes form new materials that are not usually reversible** | Iron(II) Sulfide Lesson Plan | The reaction is a classic example of a permanent chemical change; pupils can discuss why the product cannot be turned back into iron and sulfur by simple means. |
| **Give reasons for uses of materials based on evidence** | ZSL Animal Materials Activity | Pupils justify why certain animal materials are suited to their functions (e.g., scales for protection, feathers for flight/insulation) using observations from the zoo visit. |
| **Classify living things based on observable characteristics** | ZSL Animal Materials Activity | The scavenger hunt naturally leads to grouping animals by the materials they produce (e.g., animals with shells, animals with fur), supporting early classification thinking. |
| **Link to non‑statutory guidance (biomimicry)** | ZSL Animal Materials Activity | The comparison table of natural vs. human‑made materials introduces the idea that engineers often copy nature to solve problems – a direct link to design technology. |

## Working Scientifically
Both resources provide opportunities to develop the ‘working scientifically’ skills that are woven throughout the primary curriculum:

| Skill | Resource | How it is developed |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| **Asking simple questions** | ZSL Animal Materials Activity | “Why do turtles have shells?” “How does fur help a polar bear survive?” |
| **Observing closely, using simple equipment** | ZSL Animal Materials Activity | Pupils use magnifying glasses (optional) to examine animal materials; they record observations systematically. |
| **Performing simple tests** | Iron(II) Sulfide Lesson Plan | The magnetic test before and after the reaction is a simple, clear test that provides evidence of a chemical change. |
| **Identifying and classifying** | Both | Classifying materials by properties (hard/soft, magnetic/non‑magnetic) and classifying animals by the materials they produce. |
| **Using results to draw simple conclusions** | Both | Pupils conclude that the properties of materials determine their uses, and that chemical reactions create new substances with different properties. |
| **Reporting on findings** | Both | The worksheets provide structured spaces for recording, which can be used as the basis for short presentations or display work. |

## Cross‑Curricular Links
| Subject | Link |
|---------|------|
| **Design and Technology** | Biomimicry – designing products inspired by animal materials (e.g., Velcro inspired by burrs, building materials inspired by honeycomb). |
| **Geography** | Considering how animal materials are adaptations to different habitats (e.g., thick fur in cold climates, light‑coloured fur for camouflage in snow). |
| **Art and Design** | Creating collages or models using natural materials; studying patterns and textures in animal skins, feathers, shells. |
| **Literacy** | Writing explanatory texts about how an animal uses its material; producing a ‘field guide’ based on zoo observations. |
| **Mathematics** | Measuring masses of reactants in the chemistry demonstration; creating bar charts of material properties (e.g., number of animals with each type of material). |

## Summary
The **Materials in the Natural World** resource pack provides a coherent sequence of learning that:
1. **Starts with familiar materials** (everyday objects) and extends to **animal materials** (ZSL activity).
2. **Introduces chemical change** through a classic, reliable demonstration (iron(II) sulfide lesson).
3. **Explicitly maps** each activity to the statutory science curriculum, ensuring teachers can confidently fit the resources into their planning.
4. **Encourages cross‑curricular thinking** by linking science with DT, geography, art, literacy and maths.

By using these resources, teachers can deliver a rich, engaging unit on materials that not only meets curriculum requirements but also sparks pupils’ curiosity about the natural world and the science behind it.
